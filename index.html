              I became a mother for the first time on September 5, 2018 when I gave birth to my loving son, Mosiah.  
              He is my everything, and I love being a parent.  Two years ago, Mosiah was diagnosed with autism.  My
              dream is to ensure that he has a wonderful educational experience in an environment that appreciates his 
              unique learning style and abilities.  He is part of the reason I have decided to change careers and commit
              myself to building computer applications.  Mosiah is fascinated with all things technological and so am I.
              In this way and in so many others, Mosiah motivates me to be a better person - healthier, smarter, more patient,
              kind and compassionate.

              My first college major was computer science.  Since I first saw computers on television, and then 
              finally in person, a small box monitor isolated on a desk in an otherwise empty room, I'd been curious
              about what was said to be the endless potential of these popular devices now more readily available 
              for public purchase and use. I was elated when my parents bought me and my siblings a Commodore 64.  
              We would take turns typing out a program in the back of the computer's manual, and I was mesmerized by
              what seemed like magic produced by this machine. I was amazed to learn that these seemingly 
              powerful machines could accomplish nothing without the human mind and its imagination.

              <br>
              But just out of high school, I was very shy and intimidated by those around me who were much more 
              familiar with the Linux operating system and could display webpages on Netscape Navigator with 
              impressive adeptness.  Although I changed majors and went on to become a professional writer and 
              teacher for more than 10 years, my curiousity about computers never waned and my willingness to become
              self-taught blossomed.  Teaching taught me to never be afraid to ask questions. I first started writing 
              programs in HTML and CSS about 6 years ago when I met a fellow teacher who was seeking a career change.
              He's now a Director of Engineering for an established company and has been a trusted mentor ever since.

              I enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at George Washington University two years ago and began writing full
              stack web applications.  Coding has provided me a landscape of opportunities to learn many more 
              programming languages, algorithms, and all things computer science.  I have come full circle and now have the tools to assist
              in technological advancement and to join others in changing the world.

            <p class="card-text">Writing gives me peace and liberation.  
              It's something I've done since I was a child.  Creating plots, characters, and acting them out on 
              stage is emotionally rewarding.  To date, I've edited three books of poetry and stories written by 
              young children.  Although writing is no longer a career choice, it is something I enjoy thoroughly 
              in my spare time.
